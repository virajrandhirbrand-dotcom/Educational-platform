## 🎓 Question Generation Strategy

The backend should:
1. Parse resume (if provided) for skills and experience
2. Analyze technical skills list
3. Generate 7 questions including:
   - 1 Introduction question
   - 2 Technical project/skill questions
   - 1 Problem-solving approach question
   - 1 Specific technology question
   - 1 Database/system design question
   - 1 Motivational question

**Technical Skills Focus:**
- Questions should reference mentioned skills
- Depth should match experience level
- Should test practical knowledge
- Should test system design thinking
